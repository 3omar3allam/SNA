DecisionDeskHQ: RT JMilesColeman: In Washington County, PA a seemingly rare D -&gt; R flip tonight was in HD-48. This seat runs between Washington City and Canonsburg. Tim O'Neal (R) won it by performing more similarly to Trump (who won it by 15%) instead of Saccone (who lost i…

#EndARelationshipIn4Words I Support Donald Trump
Just saw a tweet accusing a GOP candidate of proposing the final solution for welfare recipients unable to work. This is why Trump won. Because the people who believe that garbage have no influence. Tinfoil hats for all.

I'm not sure I want to know what happens the day Trump supporters realize they've allowed themselves to be duped this badly
Establish a firm date for negotiation and then begin to push the parameters of the situation. It makes for a deadline for decisions before meeting. It's classic. It's not Trumpian, so he never imagined it. Trump just lies to both sides until they both agree.
The wildest allegation in the dossier was never the pee tape: Steele even reported that the Russians weren’t planning to use it because the Trump camp wanted to play ball.  It was the $10B oil stock payoff.

so. things learned today gaza is in a rly bad place and 60+ ppl were killed yesterday. 70 years today since terrible regime started.  saw into syrian war and genicide happening right now stuff is bad.
Trump made fun of the disabled during 2016. Disabled people said electing him would put our lives at risk. Now it's 2018 and a GOP candidate is suggesting we kill disabled people.   You were warned.
Every where you look people are dying because of Trump
North Korea resumes normal service. Suspends inter-Korean talks over US/ROK military drill, threatens to cancel Trump summit. Kim Jong Un also draws his red line - no denuclearisation. Trump’s triumphalism on coercing Kim into talks doubtless also fuelling DPRK ire. #NorthKorea

Donald Trump!😂
One great thing about Trump pulling Sessions up to be his ass-whipping boy..and damn if he isn’t tied to the whipping post, is he’s not one of my two bastard senators anymore.
I was at Starters on Plymouth yesterday and they wanna start doggin the east side, but soon as I say “I heard Trump from the west side grabbing y’all mommas by the pu**y” niggas get offensive and sensitive 😒.
Trump is gonna take credit for any progress with North Korea, but we all know it was Dennis Rodman that did the heavy lifting..
#NorthKorea threw #Trump ’s planned summit meeting with its leader, Kim Jong-un, into doubt on Wednesday, threatening to call off the landmark encounter if the US insisted on “unilateral nuclear abandonment.”  What is next in this #TrumpKimSummit drama?

Any U.S. government official who pushed this Trump/Russia collusion crap should be charged with treason and treated as a criminal.
Spike Lee is courageous in speakly honestly and truthfully about Trump. Much respect to Spike Lee.
The whole "Get on the Trump Train!" thing is retarded. Like, he's the president, you idiot. We are all ending up at the same destination at the same time, regardless of political affiliation. You think he's going to give you a voucher for a free sundae at Baskin Robbins?
I'll love it when US Marshals put the notice on every door of Trump Inc  (the oldest US law enforcement agency is the one that takes ownership of and then sells off assets seized due to ill gotten gain)
oh god FCB's new kit 18/19 is so beautiful 😭 i need to update my jerseys!
1) Q is the last refuge for those who wished POTUS was indeed a Jew-hater. These types want to support and believe in POTUS so much. Yet, their hatred of Jews and the state of Israel is such that they cant accept what is obviously true- that President Trump is a friend of Israel.
#EndARelationshipIn4Words I Support Donald Trump...  #NotInThisLifetime
Donald trump needs to be voted out
Reports indicate that Vladimir Putin was found guilty of harassing a disabled rescue dog while you were distracted by Trump's tweets. Sad!
Many want to talk about the Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Which Israel should withdraw from.  The same people rarely want to talk about the Hamas aim to destroy Israel and their complicit relationship with the Iranian regime.  #Gaza
ffUUUCK YOuuu, donald trump
ZTE is banned by every intelligence agency. No longer allowed. Carrier jobs went overseas after Trump promised to keep them here. Cohen allegedly sold time with trump to ZTE. 45 meets with China rep. They give huge investment. Trump’s Indonesian hotel, golf course got go ahead
Hey China, after Trump helps you with jobs, he may try to help give you tax cuts. If he does... Run. Run hard, run fast and don't look back. Use your great wall to distract him. He'll stop to admire it, giving you enough time to escape. You're welcome.

North Korea says it may blow off Trump meeting, and 'sinister' US won't make it give up nukes
The trump card sucks but it always has befits?
As a salesman, Trump should have realized that even a short wait to talk with Kim could blow the deal...
While all anyone talked/asked about was Stormy or an insult by a staffer, HUGE loans were obtained by Jared from Saudis and Trump properties w/China. Trump doesn't care if the coverage is bad or good; only that he steers it to his advantage. Try NOT covering him for a day.
the #Gaza protests involve Hamas, therefore the Palestinian protesters are terrorists   =  a fish has peed in the ocean, therefore the ocean is made of pee
NUTTY DICTATOR AND THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE : Donald Trump wont win any prize if kim jong un has a say in it.....Who knows what the crap he will do.....ITS just as well , the only award Donald Trump deserves is one for being the biggest jerk to ever hold office.
Trump is the best #MAGA
Where's America as Trump messes up the world?
MSM focus on this Cleveland Cavaliers debacle completely ignores this Melania Trump fiasco.
Trump's message to everyone is his orbit is not that they don't have to have a moral compass to work for him. His message to them is that if they have any semblance of a moral compass, they need to check it at the door in order to work for him.
Trump is the dajal tbh

SHITHOLE-IN-CHIEF TRUMP Ordered the Federal Govt. TO SAVE CHINESE JOBS!! But TRUMP Has NOT Ordered the Fed. Govt. TO CLEAN UP FLINT's WATER!
obviously I care deeply about Gaza and this conflict but I also care about my family feeling safe and secure as a religious/ethnic minority in a country 6,000 miles away from the violence, and today we don’t.
Why is our Commerce department trying to save jobs in China at ZTE. Appears this is part of a “deal” in which China will put up $500 million for an investment park  where Trump plans a hotel. Hmmmmm
Mueller thing with fake dossier and now a mole planted by Obama administration into #Trump campaign &amp; Peter Strzouk stuff doesn't make Watergate look like a 3rd rate burglary. It makes Watergate look like an elementary kid stealing another kid's Speed Racer lunchbox in 5th grade.

2) Therefore, when POTUS does blatantly pro-Israel things (like moving the embassy or stating that any casualties on the Israel /Gaza border rest squarely at the feet of Hamas), these types experience severe and debilitating cognitive dissonance. They turn to Q for refuge. SAD.
In other words, the #TrumpRussia oil deal didn't HAVE to close at that point.  The Qataris may have needed something from Trump at that moment, to make the oil deal happen.

Trump hired hundreds of undocumented Polish immigrants to demolish a New York City building in 1980 and paid them as little as $4 an hour without providing proper safety equipment to do the job, court documents show. Trump "I never settle" SETTLED for $1.375 million.

The “Israel only protected its borders” thing is too facile. Israel has long resisted 2-state solution, which would make the fence with Gaza an int’l border. It’s not. Gaza is occupied Israeli territory, on which it killed 60 people.

7. So a logical step would be to not piss off Trump's fans. The imbecile who came up with this new banning technique clearly hadn’t thought of that.🤦‍♂️  Many of us aren't 'left'or 'right', B/C we don't recognise those labels.   We are independent, a mix of both positions.
Even if Trump was doing things I liked or that helped me personally (he isn’t) I’d still hate him for being a vile treasonous dumbass POS.
Israel is evil. I dont like to put my political opinions on twitter but I mean come on... Most Americans are too uneducated to know that whats going on in the Gaza strip is against everything that THEY believe in.
Once Trump is out can we send his supporters to a penal colony...maybe fill up the gulags in Siberia or something..

If Goldman Sachs etc had been punished for their bullshit subprime loans, and Cheney etc had been punished for the Iraq War, maybe more people would care that Trump is getting away with all this shit.

I feel like I'm actually getting my life together. I bought new vitamins, and I'm revamping some important writing of mine. I mean, I can't keep Trump from running amok, so I'll try to sharpen everything else.
The riots in #Gaza with arms and bombs to break the border fence into #Israel is same as the riots in Benghazi. This is not a civil protest, the ppl led by Hamas brutality to get into Israel for war this is definitely not a Peace march.
They say liberals worry too much about identity politics yet helped Trump win because of their obsession with American nationalist identity politics
So if Kim signs a treaty with the US then decides to cancel is he any worse than Trump for doing the same with Iran??

Trump doesn't hear Laurel or Yanny. He only hears "Hannity."
Trump supporters who don't care about the Stormy Daniels scandal or the Russia investigation are people who don't care about America.  Many of them or neo-Nazis, white supremacist or Hitler sympathizers.  And definitely un-American.  So they stay with Trump no matter what.
I learn this move from Mr. Trump.

When is John McCain going to apologize for the vile things he said about President Trump and his supporters? Has he apologized for leaving his first wife (and three children) when she became disabled and disfigured in an accident? #draintheswamp
What the Democrats should do is follow the playbooks of ex-President Barrack Obama, Doug Jones, and Conor Lamb,  that's how they won elections and Democrats should follow their lead, leave the Trump bashing to the voters who disapprove Trump the most. #BlueWave2018 #Resist

🤡   The Orange Face Clown thinks that the United States is part of Trump Enterprises by Extension. Hiding money, bribery, money laundering, blackmail. He's being doing it for yrs. Now it has become blatant with ZTE
I'm just hazarding a guess that Trump isn't going to say a single word condemning the Israeli attack on those medical personnel. It's a war crime, but no one will do a thing.
I’m ticked at Kelly #Sadler. But we have unrepentant slaughter in #gaza, $500 mil quid pro quo by China to support a phone maker by paying off trump, and the Qatari #Rosneft bribery mess. Scream loudest at the crimes not the rudeness.
Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba will take a proposal to Cabinet regarding the reviewing of visa regulations for Israeli citizens. This follows Monday’s bloodbath in the Gaza when Israeli soldiers shot and killed more than fifty Palestinians.
Since the GOP isn't talking about impeachment today after 500 million Quid Pro Quo,  did they ask Donald J Trump to share something?
Nothing dumber than a Trump supporter. Can I get a witness??
Trump and his admin once again demonstrate their total ineptitude at dealing with international states. NK is tired of all the Trump gloating when it is certainly unwarranted. However, not as annoyed as most American's are who understand.
So, what did Trump do, while I was at work? What did I miss this time?
I know it’s been said, but North Korea is really good at playing other nations. Trump is a narcissist, and fell right into the trap. I hope peace comes, but I am skeptical.

A couple of days/weeks ago, d World was celebrating d historic meeting between d leaders of North  Korea and South Korea. Fast -Forqard to today, d "marriage" seems like it would "beeak". The anticipated meeting with President Kim(SK) and Donald Trump in Singapore is also thretnd
It’s particularly sad that libtards are ‘overjoyed’ this morning at negative statements from North Korea about trump talks. The morons once again missing the point that there’s ALREADY been huge progress &amp; all NK are doing is maximising negotiation position. Grow up ya weirdos.

It's hard to tell Trump that ended in varying degrees of eclipse:
I dare ya.. Who is smart enough to deal with me?   Gimme a challenge. Please... Our leader in Canada. Well he isn't one of them. Just another poster boy living off daddy. Fuk him too. Go pump Trumps zone like you do... Canada owns Trump. We just need to see it for what it is.

ANC was a terrorist organisation during apartheid in South Africa, The NRM ruling party in Uganda was a rebel group that brought about a stable region, Hamas is fighting a Zionist apartheid in Israel for the freedom of Palestinians both in the west bank and Gaza #humanity
Iran and Hamas are civilized, while Israel’s democracy is a sham.  Kim Jong Un is right. About everything.   The American media are all about facts and logic, never failing to provide context.  Obama’s transition team handed the levers of power to Trump w pure class.
The next leak out of the White House should be Trump is considering changing the Presidents term to 6 years by executive order.

He’s like Jeb Bush. Just a completely milquetoast nerd with no balls to support Trump directly, saying whatever his dildo DC advisors recommend. I can’t support the guy. Or Jeff Johnson for that matter
or, maybe, in a universe where Donald Trump is a TV actor... badger
I’m sorry, but the same people that thought Acts of Violence with Bruce Willis (yes that’s a real movie) is a better action movie than John Wick also universally voted for trump over Hillary Clinton and I just can’t be silent about this anymore
Omfg America. If you re elect Trump in 2020 I will officially disown you.
Forget the Trump/Kim meeting, the most important event in Korea is gonna be RAN3#100!
Donald Trump is appeasing the North Koreans, which is unacceptable. They paralyzed America with fear, and he repays them by offering to...uphold their economy? Fuck no. We don't need another president who appeases the Kim regime. We don't need a Kim regime period.

Much of what trump has done is adversely affecting our national security, but getting rid of the cyber chief/dept is intolerable. Congress needs to act now. Repubs know how dangerous this is. If they do nothing, it’s tantamount to treason.

Having secured the promise of the Trump summit, Kim Jong Un has already won the long-desired “recognition” from US—can walk away with position strengthened. Summit cancel threat classic North Korea brinkmanship. Expect more such post summit - assuming it happens. #NorthKorea

After some reflection, it's not entirely clear to me that Eliason is right, b/c the allegation is that Cohen would funnel the money to *Trump family members.*   It might be a distinction w/out a difference as far as Trump is concerned, but what about the law?

The Sharpeville massacre in South Africa in 1960 killed 69 people. Israel killed 60 Palestinians at the Gaza border on Monday.

Alright. I’ve ignored someone in my timeline despite angrily disagreeing with their opinion for a long time. But today they go. Justifying the behaviour at the Gaza Strip just turned my stomach too far.
President Trump! It is time to fire Jeff Sessions! He is not working in your or our best interest! You need a real Attorney General! I’m almost convinced he is a big part of the deep state, and may have been the mole in your campaign🤔🤔🤔

Melania Trump, though lovely, gracious, and apolitical, deserves savage attacks from Democrats.  WaPo is objective, and its analysis, mature.  Jen Rubin is brilliant and conservative.  Money, power and media attention mean nothing to John McCain, whose temperament is pure class.
If you've been in Twitter for more than 5 min this year you know there are two Grand Conspiracy Theories. One side says Clinton/Podesta etc are Satanic hold abusers. Other side says Russia and Trump stole the election. I'm starting to think The Web may be what ties them together

Palestinians in Gaza protesting  the move of the US Embassy to Jerusalem killed by Israelis today-   - 52 dead.  - 2400 injured including women &amp; children.   Silence is complicity - Political leaders need to speak out now &amp; condemn unreservedly.

I suppose it needs saying. The Board of Deputies does not speak for all British Jews. I do not agree with their statement on Gaza.
What if there actually was video and mountains of evidence on Anthony Weiner's laptop that Hilary and Podesta were running a child abuse and trafficking ring? What if the Russians knew and used it as leverage to negotiate with the Trump campaign?

North Korea has reportedly begun to dismantle a key nuclear test site just weeks before ruler Kim Jong-un is due to meet US President Trump for a historic summit.
The pot and the kettle? While the US is busy shielding Israel from their murderous attacks on unarmed Palestinian protesters, Trump and Co criticise China for shielding Burma from UN action.

Make a law where Donald Trump Was president forever, then step down after like an hour
The news coming out of Gaza every day is chilling. Legitimately fearful for the people in that region.
Trump, who cares more about appearances than anyone ever, now has to either publicity walk back ‘his’ big achievement or give into a bunch of demands. Something tells me my professor buddy will have a new favorite example soon.
Last night I dreamt that Trump said “tbh the confederate flag really does represent racism, slavery, and the oppression of people of color” and his fans were like “oh shit k true my b” and it just got me thinkin like what if this man would just say the right words to these people
Trump-Kim summit in peril? You don’t say.

Trump. Should do the world a fav. Kill yourself. Your a loser. So is half the American public who voted you in. Although. They didn't have much of a choice done there. American's should be embarrassed about this. This is what your country has come too.
Apparently if you voted for Trump you hear “Laurel”

Weird how many people are more offended that you call Gaza a concentration camp than say 60 people and an infant killed by the IDF.
Thankyou to our President Trump for making this happen
Donald Trump is a roll model for inner city kids .  Even a tweaker can become President .
Today I Learned: sometimes Donald Trump couldn't possibly be really bad, but I know I'm right.
Trump does know that he isn't the first person to get Americans released form North Korea right? News flash - its not a new thing. And to praise Kim after Otto came back brain dead tells me he is only thinking about how all this makes trump look good, only cares about himself.
Gosh!  All the CNN anchors over the last few hours have orgasmed over the reports that North Korea appears to be reverting to type.  I almost feel sympathy for Mr. Trump.  I miss the days of real journalists. Bernard Shaw, Sonia Ruseler, Ralph Begleiter, Judy Woodruff...
#moral_ascendancy whatever moral ascendency the State of Israel once held over the World, in (rightfully) reminding us of the suffering inflicted upon all of its People throughout history, has been completely obliterated in the barbarism in Gaza.
Serious question: When Trump goes to jail, will his supporters start a civil war?
N Korea cancels Inter Korean talks scheduled for Today &amp; threatens to cancel talks with US President Trump citing US - South Korea Air Exercise Max Thunder now underway. What is the future of peace in the Korean Peninsula is a major question.
If the American main stream media pushes a False Narrative that affects National security does that make them enemies of the state?  Should they be bound by the same Propaganda laws that have been imposed on RT? Why lie to the American people? Because Trump hurt your FEELINGS?

Could Israel have used less force in the past few days in Gaza?  IDK. COULD the entire ME have been less fucking hostile toward them for the past century?  We all know what terrorists are capable of, we all know who they're funded by. But yeah, the Israelis are the villains.

Gaza Residents Start To Bury Dead After Violence Along Border
What's happening is Kim Jong-Un &amp; #NorthKorea talked to china &amp; said "#Trump &amp; #Bolton have shown their hand &amp; they want regime change &amp; US bases on China border, I told you we couldn't trust them".  #r4today
South Africa, #Turkey and the Republic of #Ireland summoned Israeli ambassadors over Gaza's killings. What is the rest of the world waiting for? How many more Palestinians have to die for the international community to take action? #BDS #boycottIsrael #Gaza #Jerusalem
Trump is making so many missteps - denouement awaits. Sends shivers up my spine.
Any truth in the story that Trump has locked himself in the Oval Office to work on new insults for KIM Jong-Un if, should that be when, the talks get binned?

Ireland summoned Israel’s ambassador to protest against the fatalities at Gaza. Russia and China also expressed their concern over the killings. The American ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, threw Washington’s weight behind Israel,

Israel gave the Palestine people back the Gaza Strip. For this kindness, the Palestinians and the terrorist Hamas use human shields of children to launch rockets and bombs across the border against the Israelis and send waves of border stormers. Back in the US, MSM blames Trump.

Second rate president Donald Trump , an embarassment on his best days , is probably behind the female staffers inability to apologize for her hateful mcain statement. Trump probably told her not to give a public apology.....thats why HE IS A SECOND-RATE HUMAN BEING AND PRESIDENT.

ppl about to spend the whole trump presidency trying to get him “impeached”. just waiting for him to do something deemed terrible enough by whoever has final say in an impeachment.
We are on the verge of confirmation that Trump sold the White House to Russia for 10 billion dollars. Seems like a big deal.
The behavior by the Israeli government,is shamefull,Palestinians are throwing rocks,the don't have an air force.trump blew it again!!
USA diplomats are having a hard time with Trump in the white house ,tearing of international treaties,US is losing credibility and trust hence gradually losing its international influence,brace up folks Russia is taking over,becoming a trusted and global power player/partner!
...previous weeks. Some young men brought knives and fence cutters. At a gathering point east of Gaza City, organizers urged protesters over loudspeakers to burst through the fence, telling them Israeli soldiers were fleeing their positions, even as they were reinforcing them....
The Palestinian people’s cause has endured because of their courage and perseverance... and the sheer idiocy of leaders, theirs, Israel’s &amp; the world’s! #gaza
Donald Trump could never be cemented in history
#USA #UK #Sweden - attacked &amp; abused #JulianAssange to sabotage #Wikileaks. Persecution against him was massive. Officials have been exposed as conspiring against #Justice telling lies &amp; trying to conceal evidence of their collusion. He can't risk extradition to #Trump #torture.
The White House’s statements on the massacre in Gaza are absolutely revolting. 58 people did not deserve to die because they dared to stand up for their rights. It’s the same narrative when black people are killed by cops; completely blame the fed up abused and not the abusers.

I hate how Trump has has turned our nation against each other. We have lost friends, family, allies etc... what have we become?! Sickened beyond! Bite my head off. It’s fact!!!

Donald Trump’s Bizarro World: He says the so-called leaks are massively over exaggerated in the fake news. So the traitors and cowards are leaking only a few fake leaks to the fake news. That explains everything!
Damon:”NYTmustered all its canned moral outrage, deploying phalanx of columnists, including Brooks+Kristoff,2make case very threat of “hundreds” of civilian deaths justified bombing campaign ended up destroying an entire society. Where is their outrage over the massacre in Gaza?”

You think THIS Lars Von Trier film is controversial? The next Lars Von Trier film is going to be like an art-house 'Commando', where Jesus appears on the Gaza Strip and takes on the might of the Israeli army. Whoopi Goldberg is playing Jesus.
Israelis are called 'settlers', not 'occupiers'.  #BBCfakenews #Gaza
Let me wrap this up.  1. The US embassy is now in Jerusalem. 2. Kim Jong-Un seems to have second thoughts. 3. The EU moves forward with Iran. 4. Trump business just secured 1 billion USD from China/Chinese banks.

Novartis General Counsel Felix Ehrat will leave the Swiss drugmaker over his role in a $1.2 million contract it struck with the lawyer for U.S. President Donald Trump, saying on Wednesday the pact was legal but an error.
Trump is not Reagan he’s better!!!!!!!!
Isn't it amazing that as we get closer to the midterms, the hard Left if quickly posturing towards the middle of the road: "We see now the impeachment ticket won't work, so let's just say we will work with Trump instead of obstructing him like we've been doing."
So North Korea finally said something that is agreeable to the whole world, Trump is a ridiculous comedy.
peak 1am content, no other bear post I've made can possibly trump this
Trump is going after the NHS so he can blame the protests about his visit on that. He’ll tell America we hate him because he’s trying to stop us ripping off Americans. His voters will believe it.
Reminder: #Gaza is a concentration camp. Israel imprisons 1.8 million Palestinians in Gaza, and uses them to test weapons on.  Only 2% of Gaza's water is drinkable. Over 60% of Gaza's children are malnourished. UN says Gaza will be uninhabitable by 2020.

Funny thing about me is I proudly offer maximum campaign contributions to campaigns aligned with my ideology, yet not a single Democrat has asked this year. I have received requests from GOP organizations and even Trump for which they shall get nothing more than a lump of coal.

If I were Mr.King, I would cancel Trump summit immediately, for it is obvious that Mr. Trump wants to control Korean Peninsola by a kind of unequal &amp; imbalance talks, and he is not interested in Nobel Prize or world peace by sheduling the summit in a non-neutral country.
Full support to Israel for the way it tackled Gaza protestors. India needs to implement it urgently in Kashmir, Bengal, Kerala, North East.
After the Holocaust, I never in a million years imagined the world would stand by, do nothing, &amp; even aid those who harbor strong animosity toward the Jewish people and Israel --- until "LITERALLY HITLER" Trump honored them and their true capital.  Who are the real Nazis here?

I'm less annoyed with prominent Trump supporters who never attacked Bill's philandering, Obama's executive excesses or Hillary's national security slip ups.  So pretty much the whole GOP can go fuck themselves.

ABC is going to tone down the Trump worship for Roseanne in Season 2, okay, random thought. You have a formula WHICH WORKS, right? Why mess with it? Fox is bringing back Last Man Standing for this. Conservatives are finna be represented.
at least their prime minister is appreciating Muslims. 🤦🏻‍♀️ Smh, Trump take notes from this guy. 💯😤🤥

Hey #NobelPrize people...better hold off on inscribing #Fuckhead #Trump's name on anything, at least until forever.
Would Trump agree to give up his nukes?  Is he sane and stable eough to control a nuclear arsenal?
Trump says drugs in the US expensive because cheaper elsewhere. Nope, old man, that's because your medical aid system is based on how  insurance companies can make profit, not part of a governmental social  welfare system where the state (country) covers a substantial %.
I bet Trump would give a super enlightening and thoughtful Ted Talk
FOREIGN MINISTRY of Iran Mohammad Javad Zarif talks in Brussels about the further fate of the nuclear agreement with that country after the decision of the President of the Donald Trump of the withdrawal of the US from the. On Tuesday, Zarif met with head of EU diplomacy Chief
Okay.. so basically Cohen tried to shake down Qatar on Trump behalf, Qatar didn't want to play so Trump gelpfunds Saudi efforts to blocade that country, leading to the aweful humanitarian crisis we have now.
Palestinian refugees number in the millions --1/3 of these people live in refugee camps. Another 1.6 million Palestinians live in Israel in discrimination and segregation. Gaza is the world’s largest open-air prison. An ongoing destruction of a people, its history and culture.
Seriously?  Did ANYONE believe N. Korea was going to give up nuclear weapons?  Just Trump's stupid ego. What an ass.  USA president a public fool once again.
one day the #TrumpCult is demanding their fuhrer be given the #NobelPrize --the next trump is pushing for war games against n. korea &amp; trying to sabotage the peace agreements.
Gaza is occupied by Israel. An open air prison. Israel has no "right" to "defend" itself from people it brutally occupies. The Two State "Solution" imo is dead. Only hope is to create a single, democratic country where all Faith's and people's are respected.
Trump assistant Kelly Sadler would never dare make the caustic remark about McCain’s vote not counting unless she was pretty sure it would amuse the boss. Apparently, it did. Clearly reflects ambience of Trump White House, possible of course only because Trump revels in it.
Trump: This administration proudly follows the examples set by the Grant/Harding/Nixon administrations. Nothing to see here, folks.
When Mueller issues his subpoena he needs to issue two. One for Spanky Trump and one for his hair. I think I saw his hair in an episode of the  X files. I know that shit is alive.
Israel is not a 'murderer', it's a 'protector'.  #bbcfakenews  #Gaza
If anything it places the actions of the Israeli State in Gaza and the region in a more reprehensible light. Jews, especially Zionists should know better than almost any group (✊🏾) the scars that actions like these are likely leave with on a culture.

The regime of N.Korea is challenging against the most military power of US in the world. How will he act aganist Mr.Trump. I guess that the regime of N.Korea will be back to the former policy before Pyong Chang Olympic games.
Honestly, did anyone think that Kim was gonna give up his nukes. Only a Dotard would possibly believe Trump is gonna outwit Kim. Three generations of dictatorship vs Real Estate Broker. Really!? #TrumpKimSummit

Did you know Trump won the election?
North Korea 🇰🇵 will never willingly give up their nuclear weapons! Donald Trump has placed himself in his own trap! It’s extremely naive to believe that a man who had his step brother killed will be honest and fair. North Korea 🇰🇵 has the Trump card! 🤔
The average folk that think that by supporting &amp; empowering Trump &amp; his gang of criminals they are somehow "sticking it" to the rest of us (the non fascists), they are sadly mistaken cause 99 percent of them are being screwed with the rest of us! Rampant lawlessness hurts all.

From people I've spoken to in Gaza - everyone backs protesting against the US embassy move, the violence &amp; for refugees right to return but there is a division over whether it was worth going to the borders knowing there would be likely be a high death toll. (1 of 2)
You have any idea how many family members have been written off entirely because one side won't accept another's criticism of Donald Trump?  It's easily in the hundreds of thousands.  An ideological civil war, over a wholly corrupt conman.
Riyad Mansour, Palestine's envoy to the UN, accused Israel of committing "war crimes" against Palestinian protesters in the Gaza Strip, and slammed the UN Sec Council's failure to hold Israel accountable.  "We have begged you to prevent another massacre by Israel, the occupier,"
#EndARelationshipIn4Words I voted. For Trump.
Says it all about the vile Democrats who pretend to be for "love and peace" when they're fervently hoping that the Trump-Kim talks end in failure so they can use it as political capital. Never mind the future of the millions of Koreans and the nuclear threat NK possesses.
Donald Trump ought to be pardoned over tariffs. That is all.
Trump is trying to set a record for impeachable offenses, high crimes and misdemeanors be damned, he’s gonna rack up all of them.  Conspiracy, Election Fraud, Bribes, Money Laundering, Emoluments, Campaign Finance Violations ... he is literally adding onto the list daily. #basta
Well, now our president has made himself look like a complete idiot because he has been duped by N. Korea!  He thought because he believes he is the smartest person in the room that he could just tell N. Korea what to do and they would capitulate!  Trump is a liar who just got...
...played by the N. Korean regime!  But, that is something every president before him knew and so they didn't bother to embarrass themselves!  Now, Trump \has shown our Allies and the rest of the world that he can be conned very easily!  All you have to do is to give him praise!
Why did trump lift sanction for ZTE  ? What is America getting in return ??? Or rather  , what is trump getting in return  ???
LOL!  "But muh alex halped get Trump elected!"  No, he inserted himself for financial gain &amp; celebrity - he doesn't care about truth or Trump, he just wants to rile everyone up into a religious/superstitious fervor so that they feel totally run-down, cue the supplements adverts.

I assume #The100 is a documentary about what things will be like if Trump stays president.
Bernie Sanders isn't nearly hard enough on Israel  and he's the only senator in America who has even commented on the massacres at Gaza  this situation is so fucked
Yesterday 'some' people were considering #PresidentTrump for the #NobelPrize for Peace.  Today we see #Trump is on the verge of 3 International Relations Disasters.  First w/ dumping #IranNuclearDeal; then w/ opening Embassy in #Jerusalem; &amp; now w/ collapse of #NorthKorea Summit!
Let's be honest.  "Trump Derangement Syndrome" is the unwavering support of a man who deserves none, who has shredded every vaunted principle the right ever held dear, and who systematically exploits the Presidency for personal gain, every single day.

When someone accuses you of suffering from "Trump Derangement Syndrome", they are practicing his tired art of PROJECTION, where every criticism leveled against his opponents applies to him in spades.  Need proof?  Look at what he said about Obama. Or Clinton. Look carefully.

After 481 days, I still can’t tell if the Trump administration’s supreme ignorance is surpassed only by its unprecedented mean-spiritedness, or if it’s the other way around.
The demo last night included a phone call from a protester in Gaza.
Turkey and Israel have expelled their envoys amid growing tensions between the two sides over the killing of dozens of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip at the hands of the murderous Israeli army (assassins).
This new NK anger at US is going to screw up Trumps lightweight mind. Bolton will advocate for aggression. Look out everyone. Trump way too stupid to make right decisions about foreign affairs. Could be boots on the ground.
When Twitter is gone, President Trump will have to find some other social media to keep us informed, to keep us together so we can stand against our anti-American enemies.
Just throwing this out there: Grand Jury set up by Team Mueller can indict Kushner, Ivanka, Don Jr., Eric, Trump, and whoever else they want without talking to them if Mueller Team presents enough evidence. Trump does not need to have interview w Mueller to be indicted by GJ.
Donald Trump did more yesterday than #KeithRichards can remember having done from his whole life. #TuesdayThoughts
Pres Trump, all was going well re: North Korea. Bolton was not helpful in terms of Iraq and he is not helpful now. Get deal back on track. Military maneuvers on Korean peninsula do not help. Who's idea was that? You cannot belittle a country or person &amp; expect compromise.
SO DOES THIS MEAN TRUMP HAS TO RETURN THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE HE NEVER RECIEVED ?

Calling the fence in Gaza a ‘border’ makes it seem like Palestinians have a territory of their own. Israel controls the borders, and entry of goods. This is not Palestinian sovereignty. #DiplomacyForGaza   #StandWithGaza

Trump’s America has made me so insanely emotional that I’m not sure I can watch the clips Prince Harry following Princess Di’s funeral procession without sobbing anymore. Also I can’t believe she was only 36?!
Gee, I don’t think Trump’s gonna get that Nobel Peace Prize after all. 🙄😆 I guess that’s what happens when your Foreign Policy is a train wreck.
No way describing Israel's Gaza massacre as "defending its borders" like it's some kind of legitimate relationship between neighboring countries. Israel enclosed the population and built a fence around it.

A Two State solution is the obvious answer, that's seriously endangered (if not dead) with the US Embassy move to Jerusalem, cheered on by Trump and Netanyahu (and religious fanatics who want to fulfill an "end of days" ideology).

It fosters a culture of corruption that passes rewards to the least ethical and least conscientious people.  It's not coincidence that former Trump confidant Roy Cohn, the embodiment of NYC's corrupt power culture, got his start in the law fixing parking tickets.

No. Korea won’t even settle for the Iran nuclear deal Trump just walked away from. So if you’re counting, that’s 2/3rds of the Axis Of Evil now headed for a nuclear bomb. Well played.
There is no border because there is no Palestinian state. Israel has made sure of that. Palestinians live under occupation, with Israel controlling every aspect of their lives. In Gaza, even the air and sea are Israel’s domain. #RealFaceOfTerrorism

Kim Jung Un was never going to give up his nukes. He's not suicidal. And now the Trump-Pompeo-Bolton brain trust is going to use North Korea's refusal to do so -- which is their status quo position -- as an excuse to do something stupid. They want war.  #Neocon #Chickenhawks
Just realized it’s entirely possible at this point that Kim will offer to give up their nuke program if Trump agrees to step down as president.

I think 1 out of every 10 ppl that don’t like trump should follow him and report back to the other 9. If all 10 are following him, he’s  getting follows he doesn’t deserve.

no it's not just the US. every nation out there that is sitting back watching but doing nothing is equally as guilty. what would you do if such a genocide happened in your powerful country? #Gaza stop the killing #actnow
Still trying to wrap my head around Maajid Nawaz calling Trump an okay leader, only on foreign policy of course...  This is a man who explains to crowds how totalitarian half truth propaganda works, in his spare time...I mean, he knows how this narrative game goes.
I have a grand unified theory of 20th to 21st century history that connects Dwight Eisenhower straight to Donald Trump with a detour theough Joni Mitchell writing the definitive Woodstock song even though she wasn’t there and if you see me start tweeting it confiscate my cocaine.
Trump persiste et signe Congratulations to Deb Fischer. The people of Nebraska have seen what a great job she is doing - and it showed up at the ballot box! #MAGA
Let's be clear: Trump sits in the Oval Office because his relentless fear-mongering produced a“whitelash” in response to the browning of America. It’s a desperate and despicable effort to retain the nation’s racist hierarchy, which must be accurately understood to resist.
Mansour al-Otaibi, Kuwaiti ambassador to United Nations, said he would circulate another draft resolution Wednesday calling for United Nations to provide protection for civilians in #Gaza.  He said it would be short of a peacekeeping force, however.
The only thing taking back the house will do will be to make a quagmire out of DC, nothing will get done on either side and impeachment (nothing more than a accusation)....will be used by trump as evidence of a witch hunt....the senate (still controlled by the GOP won’t convict)
When North Korea succeeds in painting Trump/America as the barrier to peace and unification, they will have achieved one of their goals.
I saw on fox that a mexican is in kahoots with Trans People to impeach trump #thestorm
الرئيس السيسي لما بيقول إنه "داعم لأفكار الشباب حتى لو خطأ" ... بيوجه كلامه لمين؟ لمؤيديه اللى بيكرهوا الشباب؟ لكبار السن اللى بيعطوله أصواتهم؟ .. للشرطة اللى بتقبض على الشباب؟ للإعلاميين اللى بيشتموهم؟ للبرلمان اللى بيصهين على حبسهم إحتياطياً لسنوات؟ .. بيوجه كلامه لمييييين؟؟؟؟؟

It’s becoming more and more clear John Brennan ran a Russian false flag operation against the Trump campaign, using elements associated with the DOJ, the DNC, and MI6
Sounds like the FBI put a spy in Trump's campaign?   What a disgusting, embarrassing, Criminal outfit Obama's FBI has proved to be.   We need a wholesale house cleaning in FBI leadership.   Need to do it now. disgusting.
(Take this with a lot of salt. I haven’t seen any corroborating info yet, but at this point nothing Trump does would surprise me.)
The EU  &amp; UN condemns Trump for cancelling Iran nuke deal, moving embassy to Jerusalem and Israel for defending its border.  Seems what they want is for Iran &amp; Gazans to do what 2,000 years of Christianity has failed to do – eliminate Israel &amp; the Jews.
Daily reminder that Russians hacked the RNC emails but didn't release their contents. Blackmail. Still wondering what was on those servers that have Republicans acting like servile children to trump.
If you hear #laurel, you probably voted for Trump. #laureloryanny
I wish I could say to social media: For one hour please block anything with the word Gaza from my feed, or anything with the word Trump from my feed.
🔺️VERY WEIRD that no SECURITY CAMERA VIDEOTAPES nor any WITNESSES have come forward to corroborate Stormy Daniels was ever seen with or...ever was with...Donald Trump❓🔺️

We get one shot at a farm bill every five years. The #GOPFarmBill could have taken steps to protect America’s agricultural workers from Trump’s disastrous trade policy – in fact many were asking for it.
What it means: —Eagerness to meet was linked to Clinton dirt —Still not clear what Trump knew about the mtg, so TBD if he is vulnerable to accusations that he's been part of a coverup —Trump Jr. has changed his statements on this meeting many times —Manafort notes: TBD

Did the Russians meddle in the GOP primary so that Trump would be the GOP nominee?
How do you call a blocked number anyway? 🤔  Trump Tower
If the Senate will never under any circumstances convict Trump of anything, even tho proven, how can he be convicted? What hope have we of getting him out of the WH? He'll never resign. He'll burn the place down first.
I condemn the act that Trump has done regarding the movement of the United States Embassy in Jerusalem. France will never move the embassy until peace is restored in the region and the plan of two States that the United Nations has ordered is applied.
President Trump and Prime Minister Benyamin Nettanyaho, “Restart” will demonstrate it’s people power and popularity in times of turmoil.

Y’all need to watch this Netflix show called Dirty Money, specifically the episode about Donald Trump.
Try to figure out if today’s scandal is the one to bring Trump down  #ThingsIDoEveryday
Just watched some atty on Fox News saying [re Trump et al &amp; Russia] that ”all they have is someone said something false in a statement.” (paraphrasing) That’s exactly what GOP-led 90’s House voted to impeach Clinton over.
Trump met with FBI, other agencies not long ago and emphasized importance of protecting US elections from foreign interference - Director Wray
1 hell of a day for the #MAGA crowd  *Don Jr. lied *Trump help draft Jr's letter *Michael Cohen going to Jail *Don Jr going under the jail *Trump financial disclosure ugly  *Mueller's 2 new subpoenas *I could go on and on and on and on
I bet #Mueller has been trying to wrap up the Russia investigation for months now, but Trump &amp; co. keep giving him work to do. He's probably missed graduations, weddings, all kinds of functions.

Trump is on an immigration rant again. Watching it live.   What an asshole.   Yawn
Donald Trump Jr. is trying to convince investigators he never speaks to his father. Investigators find that extremely hard not to believe.

#السيسي اضرب كمان عايز اتوب ضربة قاضية ياريس
Take a look at the black unemployment rate. Ben and Trump are trying to eliminate modern day plantations that your article calls Housing. Dems. Have held their thumbs on blacks and kept as many of you as possible “needing” them and big gov. For votes.
Well, it was obvious to me that Kim had no intention of dismantling his nukes. Ceasing production, perhaps, but not dismantling. Is he going to back out first and blame Trump, causing US embarrassment? Wouldn't be surprised.
So - “Old Fire &amp; Fury” and his gimp Hannity have private conversations most every weeknight, and on many days - multiple conversations.  Would love to be a fly-on-the wall easedropping on those two morons.  No wonder the Trump Presidency is so fucked-up.
What do you get when you cross Donald Trump Jr. and a rock?  A fucking stupid rock.
السيسي وشه بيلمع وصحته رجعت 20 سنه والنعمه باينه عليه ويفتح فمه علي الاخر ويضحك من قلبه بقهقه وكان لا شئ يحدث في أمتنا يبكي الحجر
The killing of dozens of unarmed protesters and wounding of many more by Israeli forces in Gaza, on the day President Trump moved the US embassy to Jerusalem, is an outrage that demands not just international condemnation, but action.
There is 100% evidence there was collusion between Russia and Trump campaign. All Mueller has to find is any evidence that proves Trump himself orchestrated any of it....
What's the point of having great knowledge and keeping them all to yourself?  Donald Trump #quote

If you're neglectful regarding your salah or don't pray salah, enter Ramadan with an intention to never leave salah again with the help of Allah - in Ramadan &amp; even after it ever, no matter what happens.  Remember this hadith  "Between disbelief &amp; faith is abandoning the Salat."
When I go to Hollywood parties and I’m stuck in a conversation I want to get out of. I just bring up the topic - I’m a Republican and Trump is awesome, don’t you think he’s doing a great job. Boy, does that killed conversation.
Misreading traditionally-GOP voters distaste for Trump in 2018 as a sign that they're ready to embrace a new progressive agenda (single payer, free college) is a potentially-fatal mistake for a Democratic House majority.
I am a victim of you all. Donny boy (Donald trump) are a very bad thing. #NRA

Tillerson told a graduating class, if we accept Trump's lies, "Then we as American citizens are on a pathway to relinquishing our freedom."

The committee said operation was ordered by Vladimir Putin  Senate investigation concludes Russia interfered in election to help Donald Trump - breaking with conclusion of House probe  Hillary Clinton won! And if she was a white man and republican we wouldn't tolerate this bs.
Trump talking about MS-13 is hilarious very ironic his followers kill innocent people constantly while MS-13 does show much more mercy than Trump freak supporters ever will

Social Security SUCKS! Because I told them that someone had loaned me $250 so I could get some food, they are now taking $250 out of my SSD.  Between them &amp; the president, America is being run by Nazis. Trump is the true definition of a German Nazi. Hitler reincarnate.
Thompson's resolution is a response to Trump's tweet about ZTE.  FBI Director Christopher Wray, testifying before Senate Approps right now, says he “can’t speak to what anybody else was thinking" re: Trump tweet. "I’m not really a Twitter guy."
I am hoping Donald Trump will not fire Bob Miler, i think it would be fishy if he did. Perhaps impeachment will start. Donald Trump on public tv asked to find the email from Russia that asked for help. We have evidence, he wanted to hack democrat party, no doubt about it.
U voted for trump. #EndARelationshipIn4Words
I voted for Trump.  #EndARelationshipIn4Words
Has trump said anything about Hawaii ?
I'm in California.  We have MS-13 somewhere around here. But I can guarantee you that there's no way ICE is rounding them up by the thousands.  My streets are safe.  Not for Trump.  But I'm not worried about the situation at this time.   Deport Trump. He's a puppet of Putin.
Not to mention you totally ignored the effectiveness argument.  For instance, Just think how much tough guys like Flynn, Gate, Papadopoulos etc. have song like birds to classic interrogation techniques. Not even an eyelash pulled.   Unlike OBL, Trump won’t go free for a decade :)
Please, please, please have a competent #CA response to #tRump's blatant lies &amp; stupidity about #SantuaryCities #msnbc
Spike Lee making a movie based waaay before Trump takes office having David duke say "make America  great", makes him a P. O. S. ! trumps not racist! I've looked real hard for evidence and only found hillary clinton start that saying.
ان يقوم الصهاينة بمنع الطائرات التركية من نقل الجرحى من ابطال غزة نتفهمه فعدائهم لكل ماهوعربي واسلامي وعنصريتهم لايغيب عن فكر احد لكن ان يقوم النظام المصري بمنع وصول الطائرات هذا مالانستوعبه اونقبله على الاقل من الناحية الانسانية هذا اذا كانوا يفهمون معنى الانسانية
Senate Intelligence Committee: Russia meddled in U.S. Election in an effort to help President Trump - Bull crap! But we do know, for a fact, that Hillary, Obama, DNC, FBI, DOJ, NSA interfered in the election trying to get Hillary elected! Where are those stories &amp; their charges?
الواجب الحق أن يعمل المصريون الآن ؛ كلهم علي "إنهاء فترة حكم السيسي سلميا " بتوافق علي خروجه هو ومن عمل معه أو له . وأن يعمل المصريون كلهم علي أن يظل الجيش بعيداً عن الإنخراط في كل ما هو سياسي وأن تنتهي الأعمال الدعائية بالتخوين والشيطنة لكل فصائل الوطن

Wonder why our political system has so much difficulty dealing w/ the Trump corruption &amp; seems so powerless to stop the corruption &amp; bribery? Could it be that corruption &amp; bribery is the coin of the realm? Can't stop it bc corruption is perfectly fine w/ the oligarchy.
I still remember the time a white guy came up to me asking for some money for Gas , I Asked “ who he voted for “ he said “ trump “ I said well” fuck you go ask trump” 😂😂 Nd drove of , prob do it again

Being white doesn't mean being a country bigoted person from Texas or somehow related to Trump's family. White and black are not cultures and white people (as well as black people) have a lot of different cultures. Get it, it's not hard and stop with these american bullshits 👋🏼
It is not that Betsy Du Vos gleefully eats his own chew toy, it's that Donald Trump cruelly invades babies during Monday night football.
Nice to see the Real, racist Trump on display right now.  I've already counted four lies in his statement regarding Sanctuary Cities.
The reason Russia  backed trump is they knew how stupid and gullible he is.  And they proved their point over and over again.
"If I can't do whatever I want, why the hell did I become President?"  Just curious if anybody has heard Trump say this outloud yet.
Glorious day for Trump to RESIGN!👍👍  🔥Kremlin Used NRA to Help Trump in 2016, Senate Report🔥  AND  🔥Trump discloses payment to Cohen for Stormy Daniels.🔥  When will his base wake up?!?!?   #Collusion #Liarinchief
Listen... I'm pro #NetNeutrality too! But democrats are forcing the vote using the Congressional Review Act (CRA), which allows Congress, with the president's signature, to overturn recent decisions from federal agencies. There is NO WAY the house and Trump will sign this.
I see Trump is going with "BROWN PEOPLE WILL MURDER YOU AND YOUR WHITE BABIES" deflection again.

Just another day in Trump's America..
Schiff: “The House Intel Committee Majority’s assertion that Russia did not aim to assist Trump... now stands in lonely isolation—rejected by the Intel Community... the Mueller investigation and by Intel Committee members in both chambers who have objectively reviewed the facts.”
Asked if Trump consulted with anyone at the FBI before sending his tweet, Wray replied, “I’m not aware of any discussion of that sort.”
If you take a step back and look at all the evidence that’s been uncovered of corruption, malfeasance and sheer incompetence among Trump’s gang of villains, it’s absolutely horrifying that he’s still in office, continuing to lay waste to US institutions. How long will this go on?
This whole Yanny/Laurel debate is just a sad attempt to bring back the magic of the black or white dress. But we can't go back. It's the future now and Trump is ripping families apart and put children in camps.
And I vaguely remember Trump saying at the beginning of his term that Trump Org would not pursue foreign business during his term. Did he *gasp* lie about that?
MSNBC is broadcasting Trump's BS at the Sanctuary City meeting...PLACE your MUTE button on!!!!
Trump You are a criminal how do you ask for all the other criminals to be arrested you are a joke a liar 🤥 !!!!!
Oh yeah  Before I sleep.... I hear Yanny.  Everyone who chose the other answer is -Trump voice- WRONG.
According to various sources, President is NOT required to place holdings in "blind trusts" or sell holdings, but most do so.  Trump appears to have stayed in the game but President Bush sold his holdings in Texas Rangers baseball team to avoid possible conflict of interest.
Kim Jong Un can lobs barbs at Bolton all he likes, but Bolton would remain where he is if I were Trump, and would not be expected to advocate for military action against N. Korea should they completely denuclearize.
So Trump did own Amazon and Boeing and General Electric. When did he sell?
... fighting the good fight. The only thing that will save us now is a drastic change in course. Perhaps the #progressive movement will lead the way to a better future. I want that with all my heart. We NEED to cast aside the divisions that #Trump embodies. We NEED to come ...
TRUMP LIVE RE CA SANCTUARY STATE STATUS: "CATCH AND RELEASE.  THINK ABOUT IT."
People saying trump cannot be compared to Hitler because he is not having people killed en masse. Hitler had not begun that this far into his regime either. It was not until later that it began happening. The holocaust did not fall to earth fully formed, it happened in steps  1/6
I’ll vote for Trump next term if he expels Canada from the earth and retroactively negates all baseball stats accumulated by their teams.
Trump is insane. The people sitting in the rom with his m are beneath contempt.

What the GOP led Senate Intel Comm. confirmed today is that Putin launched a massive misinformation campaign to help Trump win &amp; Hillary lose  Trumps supporters: If you are Pro-Trump you are also Pro-Putin  Putin is a murderous dictator  If you are Pro-Putin you are Anti-America
The difference between the Clinton investigation and Trump investigation is that the Clinton one was a criminal case, Trump a counter intelligence case.  That’s why the FBI didn’t inform the public.  You may not like it — I certainly don’t — but I get the rationale.
i will no longer stand for all the proxy mentions of title names that ties so many people in one. i am not a north korean, i am not kim jung un, and especially i am not president donald trump; do i look white to you?
tRump has never known peace. It is a foreign element to him and his family. They only know conflict.
embargoes, get aid to the population, and stave off this looming humanitarian crisis.  With peace, NK would have the chance to open up. No more China and Russia using NK's as slave labor.  It could save millions.  But no, some people would rather hope it fails because Trump. /end
I'm in California. We already have a wall at the border.  Trump just wants to steal funds from needy people to build walls for slacker states like Arizona and Texas.    Let's deport morons.  Everybody named Trump goes first.
ايه يا جدعان براحه السيسي كده مش حيعتقنا بعد رمضان 😂
Wouldn’t it be great if Bob Mueller dropped the hammer on the trump crime family on May 17? The ultimate irony, IMHO
Again, there's no there, there! It sounds like a "deep State" set up to frame the Trump campaign! "Dirt" on Hillary" is not a crime! Never was, never will be. Another, nothing. Lets investigate Hillary!

I growled at Donald Trump because it hugged my brother
You know Trump spelled all this b******* about illegal immigrants trying to demonize them but doesn't have a harsh word for all the white people doing horrific s*** in the United States that get arrested. &amp;re arrested  &amp; re arrested.
OMG Trump is flat out lying about the stupid wall right now on live 📺. #TrumpIsTreason #TrumpLiesMatter
Violence in Gaza over past few days is horrific. Israel has the right to defend itself but must adhere to international norms. The Trump administration’s reaction is not helping.
Would you go to Trump Tower if Donald Trump Jr invited you over?

HAMAS official Salah Bardawil confirms that 50 of the 62 Gazans killed were members of HAMAS.   In other words, 81% of the people killed were terrorists. The others were human shields.   You won't hear that from our fake news networks.
Gotta wonder how these folks go on a national TV show and fail lie detector tests - and are shocked they failed. I'll bet Trump would do that too.

Sean’s theory doesn’t make any sense at all. If the TT meeting was part of an HRC plot against Trump, what did they get out of it? It wasn’t even reported until July 2017. After Trump won.
Excited that this time next year Stevie G will have us playing in the UEFA cup final #watp 😉 😁
15 of Trump’s courses brought in $221.9 million last year. Those same courses, over 15.5 months, brought in $287.8 million, according to prior disclosure.  Deflate that number, and revenue basically the same.

Trump is a hateful piece of shit. He doesn't understand what this country stands for. #MSNBC
What Midwestern people don’t know about Trump is that he’s a consummate liar. You good people who trust each other have no friend in Donald Trump. He’s goosing his business friends, for what he’s going to get out of them. He promised stuff he has no intention keeping.
Going back to 2014-2016, tons of left-leaning publications wrote about Ds becoming the party of affordable child care. Then Donald Trump won, and we went back to square 1 defending the progress made in the past 8 yrs.
Trump just said “we do better than anybody” and “we have the worst immigration laws in the world” in the same breath.   He’s such an idiot.
mr trump what about kids born in this country who are committing violent crimes more than those coming from any other country
TRUMP SAYS HE’LL GO FOR WALL FUNDING  IN NEXT SPENDING BILL , WIRES

■CNN速報(米版)：President Trump speaks at a roundtable event on sanctuary policies. Watch CNN
They learned from Trump &amp; are taking it all the way. Emboldening even more fuckery to come.
Donald Trump is having an awful week and it's only Wednesday.  And I was talking about the "Liddle" Don.  "Big" Don't week is even worse.
Listening to this Trump meeting on immigration is complete demagoguery! Hurry up Mueller #trumpisaliar
Trump tweet: Lou Barletta will be a great Senator for Pennsylvania but his opponent, Bob Casey, has been a do-nothing Senator who only shows up at election time. He votes along the Nancy Pelosi, Elizabeth Warren lines, loves sanctuary cities, bad and expensive healthcare...
Trump has dementia on TV right now, talking about rape and hammering people to death
So, let's get this straight. President Trump did not know that Mr Cohen paid $130,000 to Stormy Daniels. Then Trump knew about and did not pay back the money to mr. Cohen. Then he remembered paying them back. Are you serious. Lol let's not be too naive
Economist/YouGov poll  Trump Approval 44% approve 52% disapprove   Trump Approval economy 51% approve 39% disapprove
There’s an overwhelming signal from the Trump Administration that the rule of law in the United States only pertains to brown people and the poor. Not, God forbid, their own white collar grifting. #DACA #TrumpLies
TRUMP RE CA: "THEY WANT BORDER SECURITY. THEY WANT PROTECTION. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ALL ABOUT."
Ugh, every time there is news Trump was to distract from, he has some BS media statement, which for some reason the networks are required to cover it live?
Al-Rumaihi says Trump lawyer Michael Cohen asked him for an upfront fee of $1 million for his services in 2016
Why why why!!! Not a question... #Trump spouting hate and nonsense.
"We cannot let this butchery happen in America," Trump says, after citing an incident of illegal immigrant crime
There will be no "catch and release" for Trump
Serious case of Trump-Cohen fatigue today.
Someone should inform Stormy Daniels that sleeping with Donald Trump isn’t a ‘brag’ and either is the amount of money she was paid too. #BetterYourself
started tearing up on my drive home from my grandmas bc I don’t know the next time I’ll really be in Howell after this summer, then I passed a “Defend Trump” event downtown at the post office and what do you know, I immediately feel ready to move
Nick Bosa's whole TL is dedicated to licking Trump's asshole and hating things black people love. He's clearly hung like a hamster.
ان دافعت عن غزة أنت إخواني وإن دافعت عن درنة فأنت قاعدة وإن دافعت عن دار الإفتاء فأنت مقاتلة باه انا الآن أتبرأ من كل شخص يسب علماء الحجاز  السلفيين بن عثيمين وابن باز والألباني وغيرهم وأتقرب إلى الله بحبهم  فلماذا لا تصفوني بأني سلفي..! على غرار ما تفعلون سابقا.
trump just said that #MS13 gang members are being taken out by the thousands.....SAY WHAT ???   WTF is he talking about ...#California #SanctuaryCities Don't give up.
The year is 2021 and the Democrats are still saying they have evidence of Russia screwing up the election and have wasted years of time and billions of tax payer money on a fake witch hunt. I think everyone who voted for Trump should sue them for wasting tax payer money.
Trump likes reading about the gore of immigrants who murder.
Sweet Jesus. It is embarrassing listen to trump try to talk.
It’s amazing #Trump always talks about immigrants WHEN IT SHOWS THAT HE IS A CRIMINAL stop projecting your criminality,trump is the real #MS13 #trumplies
1 player will get a red, UEFA confirmed
Tbh I’m more torn up about Yanny v Laurel than I am anything politics / Trump related
Why won’t they release all the pages documenting Obama, Rice, Brennan, clapper, Rhodes, Rosenstein, Comey putting a spy in the Trump Campaign to set up a Russian collusion scam???? Trump Tower #NetNeutrality is a crock
trump just now re: ms-13 "grabbing them by the ••ᵗʰᵒᵘˢᵃⁿᵈˢ••" and it was definitely vintage trump.
With everything we've learned...FBI bias in text messages, "insurance policy", Strzok's London meetings, FISC irregularities, multiple unmaskings, question of altering FBI 302's, FBI outreach to Deripaska , question of FBI source in Trump campaign
It's already been confirmed that Russia did not hack into America's voting machines and there's nothing wrong with talking to anybody to "get dirt" on your opponent. So what specifically are the Never Trumpers trying to find?  "Trump Tower" "Trump Jr"
Trump says we want people based on merit.  Is he leaving?
We have the worst laws, catch and release that’s what we do, we arrest someone for rape and they only serve 3 months and we let them back out into the world so they can do it again. Should had been what trump used 👍
What is wrong with Trump's crazy Azz?
Trump is on tv right now and goddamn he is dumb.
“The Russian effort was extensive, sophisticated, and ordered by President Putin himself for the purpose of helping Donald Trump and hurting Hillary Clinton.”

Trump can barely form a sentence. It’s incredibly surreal to watch this  “Everybody’s drunk grandpa” Lie and slur and lie some more. He’s a vile man.
Improv students should study Trump. He just makes this nonsense up.  Babbles hyperbole and fictions.
#CNN should stop calling racist conman #Trump's shyster a "fixer." What the heck did he fix? Everything sleazy Tramp did has unraveled and been revealed. #RayDonovan buried bodies six seasons ago, not one of them has been found by the #LAPD or #Showtime executives. Brother!😂💜
Owen Shroyer lays out why President Trump took to Twitter and released a tirade of anger directed at James Comey following the release of 3 American prisoners of North Korea look ready to sign peace accords to draw attention to the message even if you do 😂😂😂
DONALD TRUMP IS AN EVIL FASCIST DICTATOR   But we need to pass #NetNeutrality so the government can control the internet 🤔
Trump Tower w/#Russians. The Committee says the documents suggest the #Kremlin used #NRA as a means of assisting #DonaldTrump and his campaign. Other findings according to the report:  The #NRA might also have been used to secretly fund Trump’s campaign.  The report finds that ..
defunding planned parent hood is also a fantastic idea, truely revolutionary. all hail trump.
Meanwhile the news is that Trump advisor Navarro has been excluded from the China talks scheduled for tomorrow. 😂
Trump is such a bigot and a bloody hypocrite. He does not deserve to be President. He does not deserve to be a U.S. citizen...send his Nazi ass back to Germany.
Oh my goodness, trump breaks in on the news for another one of his phony meetings in the white house. Why are the networks continuing to fall for these fake meetings? He's doing anything to stop the talks about the election fraud. Stop falling for this.
So the Senate has concluded the NRA (tax exempt) allowed its organization to be used by Russia to funnel money to the Trump campaign. So who at the NRA is legally culpable?  We are seeing the end for the NRA. It started with Parkland and has been unraveling since.  #NRASellout
CNN 12:24pm TRUMP ON WHETHER KlM JONG UN IS BLUFFING: "WE'LL SEE". . Michael O'Hanlon Senior Fellow in Foreign Policy, Brookings...

Still we have to Pray for #Gaza who is under attack   #PrayforGaza   #PrayForPalestine
قولوا له لسيادة الرئيس... غزة تصوم بلا سحور يا امبراطور .. اتق الله أنت وولاة الأمر في الحكومتين
But then, at the same time, there are too many unkind people who say vulgar things and that also needs to be addressed *cough cough Trump*
Trump harping about immigration policy right now is a sad display from a desperate man who has the walls closing in around him, going into his bag of tricks for an old reliable, tossing red meat to his dwindling rabid followers.
One thing is clear from today's developments: Hope Hicks will either receive a full presidential pardon or go to jail. Unless she had the fortitude to never have acquiesced to Trump and lied to the FBI or obstructed justice in anyway. I consider that possibility to be nil.
to support Trump, Knut Johnson, a lawyer for Sullivan, told Reuters on Tuesday. The subpoenas suggest that Mueller, who is probing Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, is focusing in part on Stone and whether he might have had advance knowledge of material
and Trump people think liberals are the snowflakes?
Donald Trump, wants American jobs right? Why is he helping Chinese companies? America sanctioned this company. Apparently he has businesses foreign countries, okay. American jobs? You're promoting Chinese jobs.
These are the most intelligent men and women within the corporate capital world we are playing chess with... These people don't wanna lose the table... The most intelligence people in the world ... who are as cold blooded as a lizard..   In Tel Lee Juntz   #Gaza
I'm pretty sure Rudy Giuliani got his law degree from Trump University.
Remember What You Did To Ronaldo During The Uefa Euro 2016 Final D.Payet? Guess What KARMA Is A Bitch!! #DimtriPayet #UELFinal #ATL #MAR
Trump is on TV now lying without regard for the truth. Not even news anymore. 🤷‍♀️
BAD DECISIONS : Higher gas from Trumps iran nuclear move , violence from Trumps jerusalem embassy move , mini- trade war from Trumps tariff talk , millions lose their health insurance as TRUMP HACKED OBAMA-CARE....there are many , many more bad decisions by DONALD TRUMP TO COME.
#MSNBC The only fake news is coming out Trump's mouth. OMG, such false facts.
Lancaster County should send thank you cards to George W Bush and Donald Trump for making everyone forget about the true worst President ever: James Buchanan
93/ Jr. told Congress there was a "substantial delta" between what Goldstone's emails told him the Trump Tower meeting would involve and what it involved. But that "delta" is imaginary: Goldstone promised dirt—Veselnitskaya offered dirt. Whether Jr. thought it good is immaterial.
